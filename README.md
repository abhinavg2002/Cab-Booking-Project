# Cab-Booking-Project
We have developed a program on static cab booking system in C++ using dijkstra algorithm.

Open the code in Code Blocks IDE. Once you open it click on build and run.
Once the program starts it will ask you to register or login. So you can do it accoring to your choice.
After that it will display all the locations that can are there in map which we have taken.
Now you have to choose your location and destination and then proceed.
Then it will display the shortest path and distance. After this you have to proceed.
It will then display three random static cabs and you have to choose out of it.
After that it will ask for confirmation of Cab you booked.
Once you confirmed it then all the intermediate locations will be printed after a gap of five seconds.
Then you will reach your destinations.
After that you will be asked to do static payment.
After payment is done you will be asked for review and ratings of the driver.
Then the program finishes.


Note - We have used sleep function in our code so dont press unnecessary Enter key. Press only when asked to do.
